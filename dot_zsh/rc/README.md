# Adding/removing Completions

Note that to add or remove any completions from this directory, the `zcompdump` file needs to be cleared to force reinitialisation of completions. This is to ensure that new completions are picked up and old completions do not have the the completion system attempt to find the completion and fail. The `zcompdump` file when using `zplug` is in this location: `$ZPLUG_HOME/zcompdump`.
